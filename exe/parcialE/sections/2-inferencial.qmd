### Question 5

Propose a situation in which you need to calculate a confidence interval for one of the variables, calculate the interval, and provide the corresponding analysis that answers that question.
  
### Question 6

The boss of the team ask you to fit a model for predicting raises (`percent_incr`) from salaries (`annual_salary`). We'll call this model `raise_1_fit`. The model follows the following equation:

$$\widehat{\text{Percent Increase}}=\hat{\beta_0}+\hat{\beta_1}\times \text{Annual Salary}$$


Which of the following is the best interpretation of the slope coefficient?

a.  For every additional \$1,000 of annual salary, the model predicts the raise to be higher, on average, by 1.59%.
b.  For every additional \$1,000 of annual salary, the raise goes up by 0.0159%.
c.  For every additional \$1,000 of annual salary, the model predicts the raise to be higher, on average, by 0.0159%.
d.  For every additional \$1,000 of annual salary, the model predicts the raise to be higher, on average, by 1.83%.


### Question 7

Does the model `raise_1_fit` satisfy the conditions of linearity, constant variance, and normality of errors? Use graphs to support your answer.


### Question 8

Two of your colleagues propose two different models to predict `percent_incr`. The first model, which they call `model_1`, makes the estimation using annual salary and a dummy variable for whether the worker has a salaried contract, as follows:

$$\widehat{\text{Percent Increase}}=\hat{\beta_0}+\hat{\beta_1}\times \text{Annual Salary}+\hat{\beta_2}\times \text{Salaried}$$

On the other hand, the second model called `model_2`, would use dummy variable for each category in `performance_rating` following:

$$\widehat{\text{Percent Increase}}=\hat{\beta_0}+\hat{\beta_1}\times \text{Annual Salary}+\hat{\beta_2}\times \text{Poor}+\hat{\beta_3}\times \text{Succesful} +\hat{\beta_4}\times \text{Top}$$

Which of the two models would you choose, and what would be your criterion?

### Question 9

The tidy model output for the `raise_2_fit` model you fit is shown below.

```{r}
#| label: raise-salary-rating-fit
#| echo: false

raise_2_fit <- linear_reg() |>
  fit(percent_incr ~ annual_salary + performance_rating, data = blizzard_salary)

tidy(raise_2_fit)
```

When your teammate sees this model output, they remark "The coefficient for `performance_ratingSuccessful` is negative, that's weird. I guess it means that people who get successful performance ratings get lower raises." How would you respond to your teammate?


### Question 10

Suppose we fit a model to predict `percent_incr` from `annual_salary` and `salary_type`. A tidy output of the model is shown below.

```{r}
#| label: raise-salary-type-fit
#| echo: false

raise_3_fit <- linear_reg() |>
  fit(percent_incr ~ annual_salary + salary_type, data = blizzard_salary)

tidy(raise_3_fit)
```

Which of the following visualizations represent this model? Explain your reasoning.

#|   salary, and salary type

The cases 'Denial' and 'Fortune Telling' in the graph below illustrate two common problems when estimating a regression line. Explain in your own words what these two problems consist of.
